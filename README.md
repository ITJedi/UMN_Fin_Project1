# Bitcoin Trading Strats

The following notebook is an attempt at using moving average to trade bitcoin. A 20 day SMA, 50 day SMA, 4 Day EMA and a 20/50 day SMA crossover strategy was used.

## Does it work?
Yes and no, depends on how profitable you want to be.
## What would be the returns?
See notebook
## What moving averages should we use?
We attempted 20 Day SMA, 50 day SMA, 4 day EMA and a 20/50 day SMA crossover.

## Does volatility matter?
Yes, it appears that you need a high degree of volatility to make the strategies profitable

## How is it all correlated to the stock market
BTC seems to go through periods of correlation and uncorrelation

## Are the profitable

I did not find the strategies to be profitable when using all bitcoin data (from 2015).

## Note
Use Bitcoin_Strats.ipynb for all bitcoin data the was available, stock correlation and dashboard. The other ipynb have different time periods of bitcoin data to see how it changes the results of the strategy (those files have the correlation and dashboard removed for performance).
